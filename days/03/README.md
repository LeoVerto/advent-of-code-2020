# Day 03 - Brainfuck
This code needs an 8-bit wrapping Brainfuck compiler/interpreter to run.

The different slopes can be set by changing the amount of `+`s in line 29.
Adding another constant for the slope count should be trivial but would require shifting
large amounts of code to the right.

For slope 5 a patch file with the necessary changes has been provided.
